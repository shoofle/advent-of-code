This is just my work on [advent of code](http://adventofcode.com/)! These are clj files that I played around with as I solved problems. I was using these in [Light Table](http://lighttable.com/), which is pretty cool. So I was executing things with cmd-enter and stuff. What I mean to say is, none of this prints any output or anything, and probably a lot of work has been lost to the depths of time. Oh well!
